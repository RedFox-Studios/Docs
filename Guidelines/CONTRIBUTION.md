# Guidelines for External Collaborators

We appreciate your interest in collaborating with us on our projects. To ensure a smooth and productive collaboration, please follow the guidelines outlined below.

## Contribution Process

### 1. Forking the Repository
- **Forking**: Begin by forking the repository you wish to contribute to. This allows you to work on your changes without affecting the main codebase.
- **Cloning**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine for development.

### 2. Branching Strategy
- **Create a Branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch based on the `main` branch. Use a descriptive name for your branch that reflects the feature or fix youâ€™re working on (e.g., `feature/add-login` or `bugfix/fix-header`).
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/add-login
  ```

### 3. Making Changes
- **Code Quality**: Follow our coding standards and best practices. Ensure your code is clean, well-documented, and adheres to the project's conventions.
- **Testing**: Write tests for any new functionality or bug fixes. Ensure all existing tests pass before submitting your changes.

## Submitting Changes

### 1. Pull Requests
- **Creating a Pull Request (PR)**: Once your changes are complete, push your branch to your forked repository and create a pull request against the main repository.
- **Descriptive Title and Description**: Use a clear and concise title for your pull request. In the description, include details about the changes made, any related issues, and steps for testing.

### 2. Reviewing Process
- **Be Open to Feedback**: Your pull request will be reviewed by our team. Be open to feedback and willing to make necessary adjustments based on suggestions.
- **Respond to Comments**: Address any comments or questions from reviewers in a timely manner to facilitate the review process.

## Communication

### 1. Collaboration Tools
- **Preferred Channels**: We primarily communicate through Discord. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the project.

### 2. Stay Updated
- **Follow Repository Updates**: Keep an eye on the repository for any updates or changes that may impact your contributions. Subscribe to notifications to stay informed.

## Code of Conduct

### 1. Respect and Inclusivity
- **Be Respectful**: Treat all collaborators with respect and maintain a positive and inclusive atmosphere.
- **Constructive Feedback**: Provide constructive feedback and be open to receiving it. Aim for collaboration, not confrontation.

### 2. Reporting Issues
- **Report Problems**: If you encounter any issues or have concerns regarding the project or collaboration process, please report them to the organization admins or project leads.
