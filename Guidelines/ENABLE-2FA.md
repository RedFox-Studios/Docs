# Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

At RedFox Studios, we prioritize the security of our organization and all its members. To enhance security and protect our repositories, we require all organization members and contributors to enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on their GitHub accounts.

## Why Enable 2FA?

- **Enhanced Security**: 2FA adds an extra layer of protection by requiring not only your password but also a second factor (like a mobile device) to access your account.
- **Protect Sensitive Information**: Ensuring that only authorized individuals can access our repositories helps safeguard sensitive data and intellectual property.
- **Compliance**: Enabling 2FA aligns with best practices in security and helps us maintain a secure development environment.

## How to Enable 2FA on GitHub

Follow these steps to enable Two-Factor Authentication on your GitHub account:

### Step 1: Sign In to GitHub
- Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account.

### Step 2: Access Account Settings
- Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select **Settings** from the dropdown menu.

### Step 3: Navigate to Security
- In the left sidebar, click on **Security**.

### Step 4: Enable Two-Factor Authentication
- Click on **Two-factor authentication**.
- Youâ€™ll see an option to enable 2FA via an authentication app or via SMS. Choose the method you prefer:
  - **Authentication App**: This is the recommended method for its added security.
  - **SMS**: You can receive codes via text messages to your mobile phone.

### Step 5: Follow the Prompts
- If you choose an authentication app, scan the QR code using your app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).
- Enter the verification code generated by the app or sent to your phone.

### Step 6: Backup Codes
- After setting up 2FA, you will be given a set of recovery codes. Save these in a secure place; they can be used to access your account if you lose access to your 2FA method.

## Conclusion

Enabling Two-Factor Authentication is a critical step in safeguarding your GitHub account and our organization. If you encounter any issues or need assistance during the setup process, please reach out to your team lead or organization admins.

Thank you for your cooperation in keeping RedFox Studios secure!
